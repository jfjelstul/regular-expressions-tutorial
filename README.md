# Regular expressions in R

This repository contains an [online tutorial](https://jfjelstul.github.io/regular-expressions-tutorial) for social scientists and lawyers about how to use regular expressions in R to clean and manipulate text data. It uses `stringr` from the `tidyverse` and the examples use excerpts from a landmark judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).
